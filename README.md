# Fine-Tuning Microsoft Phi-2 Using LoRA for Instruction-Following Tasks

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Microsoft's Phi-2 large language model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to generate structured outputs from natural language commands. The model is trained to follow instructions and output predefined JSON-based formats suitable for downstream robotic control or automation tasks.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```
output_phi2_lora/     # Directory containing final model and checkpoint files
split_output/         # Directory with train/validation JSONL datasets
split.py              # Script to split the raw dataset into train/validation sets
train.py              # Main training script using Hugging Face + PEFT
README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Dataset

Place your .jsonl file in the working directory, then use split.py to divide it:

python split.py

3. Run Training

python train.py

Trained model artifacts will be saved to the output_phi2_lora/ directory.
